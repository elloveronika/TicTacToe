v: 
player chooses value of x or o 
player clicks on a box in gameboard
check
the empty square now becomes player value
check
bot chooses a random empty square to fill in with its value
check
we get a winner
update point 

questions:
how do we identify when we get a winner to that we can alow for restart button to go off
technically we dont need a winning condtion so that we restart the game
how do we clear the gameboard but not the total points
how to i wipe all the values from the boxes 

things i have left to optimize :
page reloads after hitting reload button 
table gets cleared
points remain
when player hits start over it will then clear the entire board along with points
whent there is no winner and table is full stop the game also 
make it so the player does not override the bot value
